#### Productivity journeys are extremely personal 
- they involve a ton of failure, pit you face-to-face with discipline, and help you form a routine. They’re certainly not the most exciting hero’s journey, but they’re necessary. Productivity helps you do the things you’ve got to do, so you can do the things you want to do.Plus: along the way, many conventionally “successful” people (elite athletes, CEOs, etc.) tend to find true pleasure, or flow, in their productivity. It can fuel their sense of purpose. 
- Here, we revisit 10 such human-borne approaches to productivity. These are some of the greatest, go-getting procedures of the last century, from miracle mornings to presidential matrixes. These methods can be adapted to fit individual styles and needs, so choose the strategies that resonate with you, then tinker and refine them until you find your productivity sweet spot.

## The Eisenhower Matrix
- In a 1954 speech, President Dwight D. Eisenhower quoted a university president’s riff on the nature of prioritization: “I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” 

- Years later, Stephen Covey, the author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, unraveled that tongue-twister and used it to popularize a task management tool. The Eisenhower Matrix divides tasks into four boxes: urgent and important (do first), not urgent but important (schedule for later), urgent but not important (delegate to someone else), and neither urgent nor important (delete from your brain).
- The result is a powerful — and highly visual — representation of one’s short and long-term priorities. It takes two tasks off your plate, kicks one down the road and liberates you to channel deep work for the one that’s right in front of you.

## The 5-Second Rule
- As outlined in one of the most popular Tedx Talks of all time (“How to stop screwing yourself over,” 2011), Mel Robbins’ rule for preventing overthinking and overcoming procrastination. The 5 Second Rule has nothing to do with food dropped on the carpet; it’s a metacognition tool to propel oneself into action.

- In order to commit yourself to knocking out a task, expressing a thought or acting on an idea, you simply count down from five…four…three…two…one, and then go. Like a rocket ship — which was Robbins’ original inspiration. She devised the concept at a time when her life was crumbling apart and she was having trouble getting out of bed. This rule helped her commit to her alarm and get her life back on track.

## WOOP Goal Setting
- This is a recent one, devised by a German psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen and her research team at New York University in the 2010s. The goal-setting strategy stands for **Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, and Plan.**

- Let’s say a guy named Jack wants to run a marathon. That’s his “wish.” The outcome would be Jack’s best possible scenario from this journey — he’d be thrilled with a sub-4:00:00. The next section is critical. Jack is in his mid-forties and slowing down as of late; he has one knee surgery to his name; and the recent return-to-office, plus his kids’ packed schedules, will make training pretty difficult. Those would be his obstacles.
- The plan he crafts, though, accounts for obstacles from the get-go. They don’t change his ultimate goal. They just encourage him to craft an “if-then” framework, replete with courses of action designed to mitigate his chances of slipping. While this approach might sound self-evident, it’s natural for people (fictional Jack included) to underestimate life’s hurdles. Identifying them early on can help you stay consistent and motivated while preventing flashes of guilt down the line.

## Pomodoro Technique
- A classic, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s — with an assist from his trusty, tomato-shaped, Pomodoro kitchen timer. The process is simple:

- Choose a task you want to work on.
1. Set the timer for 25 minutes.
2. Work on the task until the timer goes off.
3. Take a short break, around five minutes.
4. Every four rounds of this, take a longer break.

- The method encourages individuals to work with the time they have, rather than fight against it. As it turns out, you can get a whole lot done in 25-minute intervals (which Cirillo refers to as a “pomodoros.”) The process prizes focus and can induce flow, by injecting a bit of urgency into whatever task you’re trying to accomplish. Oh, and, there’s a chance you may already emply some micro-form of the Pomodoro Technique. For instance: when I’m doing laundry, I try to align my emails and/or articles to the wash and dry cycles.

## Inbox Zero
- Merlin Mann’s mid--aughts credo is slightly misunderstood. Despite the name, he doesn’t think you should delete, archive or respond to all emails in your inbox.

- Mann cared less about the obsessive maintenance of an empty inbox, and more about minimizing the mental energy spent on email. The thrust: our attention is demanded by numerous inboxes — work emails, personal emails, social media, messaging apps, missed phone calls. We can’t possibly handle everything, so we should learn to prioritize what really matters to us.
- Among his recommendations are some familiar ideas (routine tech detoxes, limiting email checks to certain hours of the day) and a brilliant retrofit of the Golden Rule: treat others’ inboxes as we would want our own to be treated. Think of it as a digital stewardship, intended to cut down on unnecessary communication and time-wasting, which will benefit you, in kind.

## Paper Clip Strategy
- In his bestseller Atomic Habits, James Clear unpacks the curious tale of Trent Dyrsmid, a rookie stockbroker who managed to haul in $5 million of business in his first year and a half on the job. Dyrsmid was neither a prodigy nor a fraudster; he just knew how to play with paper clips.

- Using 120 paper clips and two jars, Dyrsmid made a habit of moving a paper clip from one jar to another after each sales call he made, providing a tangible representation of his progress throughout the day. He gamified his workplace habit formation, essentially, with the paper clips serving as both reminder and motivator for the task at hand.
- The genius of this strategy lies in its visual representation of progress. With a goal of moving every single paper clip to the other jar by the end of the day, Dyrsmid could keep easy tabs on his progress. The approach taps into a universal truth of behavior change: to build a habit, you simply have to do the thing.
