### Key Takeaways

1. It is your duty to express dissent to senior executives.
  a. Rules to disagreements:
    * Do not take anything personally.
    * There is no time for BS (be prepared).
    * Keep your values, show respect, and maintain integrity.
  b. How to be prepared:
    * Find the right moments to disagree:
      * Group meeting vs private 1:1.
      * Package your idea with other new ideas being considered.
      * Tie in with external context (e.g. new AI technology).
      * Ask people who know the senior executive well for insight (e.g. ideal moment and place to engage, best method to engage).
   * Have buy-in with the right stakeholders and allies before going to the senior executive.
   * Have your data and anecdotes ready.

2. You can disagree without saying: “I disagree”
  * Try the following phrases:
    * “May I offer a different perspective?”
    * “If we do XYZ, then we cannot do ABC.”
    * “Have we considered this other point of view?”
    * “I have reasons to believe this won’t work, will it be okay for me to explain my reasoning?”

3. The biggest mistake people make is trying to influence without first building credibility.
  * Anticipate the question: “Why should I listen to you?”
  * Ways to build credibility:
    * Build a relationship ahead and know the other person’s/team’s goals.
    * If you have trouble understanding why someone insists on certain things, figure out the root cause. Where is it coming from? What are their goals? Are they trying to get promoted?
    * Many teams fail because they never had a proper kickoff. Instead, they jump straight into “You do X, you do Y” without understanding the bigger picture, how goals are aligned, and the people involved.
  * Do not assume. Ask. Example prompts:
    * How can I support you?
    * Where do you see your career going?
    * Are you excited about your trajectory here?
    * Where do you see this project going?
    * What are your OKRs and how can I help you achieve your goals while I achieve mine?
  * Do NOT underestimate the influence of an internal newsletter.
    * You control the message and build a personal brand.
    * Frequent updates and insights (e.g. customer feedback) gradually build your credibility with senior executives you rarely engage with.
    * Add a “Credit goes to…” and “Advisors…” section when announcing a celebratory launch to spotlight stakeholders.

* It doesn't matter if you're right ... if you can't get others to join you.

* Whether you have formal authority or not, you need influencing skills. Unless you’re the CEO, your levels of authority are limited, making it difficult to shape decisions or keep people accountable. This can lead to missed deadlines and a sense of frustration and disempowerment. You might feel behind, stuck in your career, or worse, like you’re never taken seriously.
