## Engineering Leadership: Tools and Techniques


### Key Focus Areas
- Consciously addressing Technical Debt
- Enhancing team productivity and well-being
- Leveraging DORA research for organizational and team enhancement
- Developing your initial data dashboards
- Conducting effective 1:1 sessions with team members
- Maximizing the value of each week of your work as an engineering leader

### Tech Debt — How to Approach It
Technical debt refers
Technical debt refers to issues within your tech stack that stop you from achieving product or business goals.

Code quality, testing, automation, coupling, architecture, performance, and security can all contribute to tech debt. However, they only become problematic if they block potential business outcomes.

There are two general strategies for addressing tech debt:

- Continuous improvement — every task brings something good to your tech stack. You, as a leader, must bring clear expectations for the desired state of the tech stack. You should set clear metrics, discuss progress, remove obstacles, and celebrate milestones.
- Big project — not everything can be done in “20% time for tech excellence”. The leader’s job is to make these business goals and put them into the product roadmap. You have to make management willing to make this change so you can focus on doing a great job rather than fighting for priority.

### Ten Types of Technical Debt
Some companies, like Google, have developed their classification of technical debt. Here are ten types identified by Google:

- Migration is needed or in progress.
- Documentation on projects and application programming interfaces (APIs).
- Testing.
- Code quality.
- Dead and/or abandoned code.
- Code degradation.
- The team lacks necessary expertise.
- Dependencies.
- Poorly executed or abandoned migrations.
- Release process.

## Top Ten Factors of Developers’ Productivity
Boosting the productivity of software engineering teams is often challenging. The question arises: should the focus be on technicalities like better tools, processes, or tech stack? Or should it be on human-related factors like team relationships, psychological safety, or candid feedback?

Google researchers investigated What Predicts Software Developers’ Productivity? and identified 48 factors.

### Here are the top ten (self-assessment, based on the statement “I regularly reach a high level of productivity”):

- I am enthusiastic about my job.
- People on my project are supportive of new ideas.
- My job allows me to decide how I complete my work.
- My job allows me to manage my time.
- The project managers are highly capable, efficient, communicative, and cooperative.
- The information I receive (bug reports, user stories, etc.) is accurate.
- I feel positively about my project team.
- My job allows me to use my judgment in my work.
- My project resolves conflicts quickly.
- The coders on my software are highly capable, efficient, communicative, and cooperative.

### What We Can Learn from DORA Research
Google’s recent release of its annual “Accelerate State of DevOps Report 2023” (link) offers valuable insights for engineering teams. Now in its ninth year, this research helps teams understand their performance and its impact on organizations.

DORA is an excellent resource for upper-level engineering leaders, providing hints for steering the entire tech organization. The State of DevOps report is also a great inspiration for first-level Engineering Leaders. In empowered engineering organizations, culture is cultivated through both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

#### Key findings from this year’s research include:
- “Teams with generative cultures achieve 30% higher organizational performance.”
- “Teams focusing on the user have 40% higher organizational performance.”
- “A user-centric approach to building applications and services strongly predicts overall organizational performance.”
 
## Bring Data to Your Decisions
Working with data is a crucial activity for leaders. The ability to measure progress, and track KPIs or SLIs makes you a more effective leader.

You don’t always need complex solutions for measuring your work. Sometimes, a simple dashboard built in a few hours suffices. There are existing solutions that can be employed in your work.

PEM’s readers have been inspired on how to build data dashboards using tools like Google Looker Studio, Google Sheets, CSV files, Colab, and others. You can check it out here: Simple Data Tracking Solutions for Engineering Leaders

## Mastering 1:1 Sessions
If there’s one critical activity for every engineering manager, it’s regular 1:1 meetings with team members. As a leader, you deal with strategy, goals, organizational culture, feedback, priorities, etc:

- 1:1 meetings are where you make these abstract concepts tangible.
- 1:1s are where you support your team in reaching their potential and succeeding professionally.
- 1:1s are where you translate strategic objectives into daily actions.
- 1:1s are where you foster the company’s culture.
- Starting your first 1:1 meetings can be daunting. You must bring structure and continuity to these sessions, ensuring they are valuable for your team members and you.

On Practical Engineering Management, you’ll find materials on running these meetings, their core principles, and focus areas.

## Maximizing Each Week
As an engineering leader, you often face more work than you can handle. Unlike individual contributors, who typically have their work prioritized for them, your prioritization process is different. While you still deal with objectives or projects from top management, you must also juggle initiatives, team growth, roadmaps, technical debt, and more.

Leadership can be
Leadership can be rewarding, as your impact can grow indefinitely. However, it’s also challenging. You may have busy weeks with uncertain achievements. It’s easy to become lost among critical priorities, team struggles, long-term goals, and short-term initiatives.

One of PEM’s premium contents, Leader’s Week Framework, assists in maximizing the value of every week of your work:

- It teaches you to focus on the right things and plan your week.
- It helps you select initiatives that generate the most value for you, your team, and the company.
- It guides you to become an effective leader, earning trust for greater autonomy and ownership in future projects.
- It enables you to understand your potential and the value you bring to the organization, boosting your self-confidence.
