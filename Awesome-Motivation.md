## Awesome Motivation

* "Your level of success "will seldom exceed your level of personal development, "because success is something you attract "by the person you become." 

* Hold a holistic view of organization’s ecosystem and stakeholders. Anticipate major shifts in the marketplace and identify emerging opportunities. Know how to work within resource limitations and make tough calls to reach the team’s goals. 

* **Premium Positioning is a choice** , just as wealth is a choice, and no one else can make that choice for you.
    
* The barrier to entry for thoughtleadership exists only in your mind. If you have the courage to try, chances are that you can become an industry thought leader.

* It is almost impossible to get rich without working hard. However it is entirely possible to work hard and never get rich. **Percieved expertise determines the value of your work.**

* **Bring "Sizzle" as well as "Substance"**
  * Sizzle = Personality
  * Substance = Plan
  * You need to have passion for what you do!
    * And be able to convey passion to others
    * In how you speak, tone of voice
    * ideas , dress
  * How powerful interactions influence perceptions
  * "You can't be half a leader , you need to be all-in or not at all"
  * "Unsuprisingly what you wont find is anybody below the CEO level ever saying that the reason they get up in the morning is to increase the shareholder revenue"

* **Ruthlessly prioritize**
  * To ruthlessly prioritize, you must be able to answer the question, “What’s the most important thing I need to accomplish in this role?” Keep your goals front and center and get comfortable saying no and pushing back on competing demands, which can be tough for conflict-averse Strivers.
  * I look at my goals, I'm like okay, of the infinite things I could work on today, and out of the 20 things that are on my goal and to do list, what are the three that will make the biggest impact for me right now, and move me forward toward my most important goals? 

* Create and inspire people to work towards a vision of what’s possible. Don’t stand still. They are constantly moving their team towards ambitious targets, experimenting, and making informed bets. The Harvard Business Review describes strategic thinking this way: “Strategic people create connections between ideas, plans, and people that others fail to see.”

* Your ability to see nuance, uncover patterns, and synthesize data makes you especially original, creative, and suited for strategy.

* **Use visualization to motivate yourself**
   * Two things on it. Number one is the world's best athletes almost all of them use visualization including UFC fighters, right. And there's a reason for that. It's they visualize themself performing optimally and achieving their goals so that they go there mentally and emotionally before they ever step on the court or before they ever open the book or before they ever, right. They've already gone there in their mind so when it's realtime, when it's game time, when it's practice them it's that much easier to go there.
   * And the other thing I'll say on visualization is don't just visualize the end result. Visualize, in fact more important, visualize the activity. See yourself getting on the phone to make those calls. See yourself opening your computer to write those words that's going to make that into a book. See yourself going to the gym or lacing up your running shoes and heading out your front door. Especially if you don't feel like it or you don't like doing those things. See yourself doing it with a smile on your face in a way that's appealing.
  
* **Compound yourself**
  * You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.
  * your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.
 
* **Have almost too much self-belief**
  * Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.
  * If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.

* **Learn to think independently**
  * “I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.
  * One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. 
  * Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.
 
* **Get good at “sales”**
  * Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.
  * Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.
  * The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. 

* **Make it easy to take risks**
  * Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.

* **Focus**
  * Focus is a force multiplier on work.
  * Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.
  * I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.
 
* **Work hard**
  * Extreme people get extreme results.
  * You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.
 
* **Be bold**
  * Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.

* **Be willful**
  * A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.
  * People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.
  * To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.
 
* **Be hard to compete with**
  * But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.
  * The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.

* **Build a network**
  * The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.
  * One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x.
  * A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.
  * I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.
 
* **Be internally driven**
  * First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks. You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.
  * Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.
  * The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; 
  * After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.
  * Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.
 
* **The expert Phenomenon**
    * As you build your business and brand in your presentations, pitches and writing , in your networking and socializing, it is entirely possible to position yourself as an industry expert on purpose, to become iconic by design.
