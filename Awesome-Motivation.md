## Awesome Motivation

* "Your level of success "will seldom exceed your level of personal development, "because success is something you attract "by the person you become." 

* Hold a holistic view of organization’s ecosystem and stakeholders. Anticipate major shifts in the marketplace and identify emerging opportunities. Know how to work within resource limitations and make tough calls to reach the team’s goals. 

* Ruthlessly prioritize
  * To ruthlessly prioritize, you must be able to answer the question, “What’s the most important thing I need to accomplish in this role?” Keep your goals front and center and get comfortable saying no and pushing back on competing demands, which can be tough for conflict-averse Strivers.
  * I look at my goals, I'm like okay, of the infinite things I could work on today, and out of the 20 things that are on my goal and to do list, what are the three that will make the biggest impact for me right now, and move me forward toward my most important goals? 

* Create and inspire people to work towards a vision of what’s possible. Don’t stand still. They are constantly moving their team towards ambitious targets, experimenting, and making informed bets. The Harvard Business Review describes strategic thinking this way: “Strategic people create connections between ideas, plans, and people that others fail to see.”

* Your ability to see nuance, uncover patterns, and synthesize data makes you especially original, creative, and suited for strategy.

* Use visualization to motivate yourself
  * Two things on it. Number one is the world's best athletes almost all of them use visualization including UFC fighters, right. And there's a reason for that. It's they visualize themself performing optimally and achieving their goals so that they go there mentally and emotionally before they ever step on the court or before they ever open the book or before they ever, right. They've already gone there in their mind so when it's realtime, when it's game time, when it's practice them it's that much easier to go there.
  * And the other thing I'll say on visualization is don't just visualize the end result. Visualize, in fact more important, visualize the activity. See yourself getting on the phone to make those calls. See yourself opening your computer to write those words that's going to make that into a book. See yourself going to the gym or lacing up your running shoes and heading out your front door. Especially if you don't feel like it or you don't like doing those things. See yourself doing it with a smile on your face in a way that's appealing.
