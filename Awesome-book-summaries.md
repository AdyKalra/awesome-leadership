### Working Backwards - Amazon
Lessons learned and scars earned
Work hard, Have fun, Make History

1. Culture is 4 things:
    Customer Obsession over competitor obsession
    Willingness to think long term (longer investment horizon than peers)
    Eagerness to Invent (hand in hand with failiure)
    Taking professional pride in Operational Excellence

2. 14 leadership principles - Reinforcing the bar raising culture
    Bar raiser hiring process - Top talent
    Single Threaded leader that optimizes for speed and innovation 

3. Technical Advisor / Jeffs shadow / Chief of staff

4. Leadership Principles
   Dive Deep - Data driven decision making and frequent auditing
   Insist on highest standards - leaders have relentlessly high and many ppl think they are unreasonalbly high
   Always seek to improve the status quo
   Used In Interviews, Performance calibrations, 
   1. Customer Obsession
      "Leaders start with the customer and work behind the scene. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although Amazon leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers."
   2. Ownership
"Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, "that's not my job."
   3. Invent and Simplify
"Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, seek fresh ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time."
    4. Are Right, a Lot
"Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts."
    5. Learn and Be Curious
"Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them."
    6.  Hire and Develop the Best
"Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice."
    7. Insist on the Highest Standards
"Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed, so they stay fixed."
    8.  Think Big
"Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers."
    9. Bias for Action
"Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. Amazon values calculated risk-taking attitude."
    10.  Frugality
"We try not to spend money on things that don't matter to customers. Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for headcount, budget size, or fixed expense."
    11. Earn Trust
"Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best."
    12.  Dive Deep
"Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently. No task is beneath them."
    13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
"Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly."
    14.  Deliver Results
"Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle."

- Performance based compensation
Bulk of the compensation is based on long term value, wrong type of compensation can create misalignment
  - rewarding short term goals at the expense of long term value creation
  - rewarding the achievemnet of localised milestones 
  - Intentionally push revenue targets/overspend marketing funds/defer expenses/cut back hiring/delay promotions
 
**Hiring**
- Bar raising process
- Lack of rigorous model, unintentional bias, team members share insights - confirmation bias, time pressure, quality of written evaluation / lack of, personal bias
